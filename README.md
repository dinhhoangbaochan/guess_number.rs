# JUSTRUST Guess Game

A number guessing game in the terminal built with Rust. This is the first project you would build if you learn Rust from the Rust book.

## Game description.

There's a secret number that is generated when the game is started and it's ranged from 1 to 100. Users have to guess the correct number and game only ends when the correct number is found.

- Initialize a secret number and it should be random.
- Game should run forever unless correct answer is found, so it should have an infinite loop.
- Take user input, which should be a number.
- Compare user's input with the secret number.
- If correct answer is found, break the loop.
